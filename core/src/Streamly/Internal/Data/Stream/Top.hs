-- Top level module that can depend on all other lower level Stream modules.
--
-- Design notes:
--
-- The order of arguments in the join operations should ideally be opposite. It
-- should be such that the infinite stream is the last one. The transformation
-- should be on the last argument, so if you curry the functions with all other
-- arguments we get a @Stream -> Stream@ function. The first stream argument
-- may be considered as a config or modifier for the operation.
--
-- Benefit of changing the order is that we get a more intuitive Stream ->
-- Stream transformation after currying all other arguments. The inner loop
-- streams become arguments for the transformation, more like local modifiers
-- for the global outer stream as the last argument. Thus we can continue using
-- transformations on the outer stream in a composed pipeline. Otherwise we can
-- use flip to flip the order.
--
-- The fact that the inner stream can be used in the loop multiple times also
-- tells that this is not the real effectful stream, it is more like a pure
-- stream or an array. In fact we may consider using an Identity streams as
-- inner streams in which case these functions will not look nice.
--
-- Downsides:
--
-- * Maybe less intuitive to think about, because we usually think the first
--   stream as the outer loop and second as the inner.
-- * Zip and merge operations will continue using the opposite order.
-- * Need to change the order of cross, crossWith operations as well
-- * It will be inconsistent with Data.List. The functions cannot be used as
-- intuitive operators.
--
-- The choice is similar to concatMap vs bind. concatMap is pipeline
-- composition friendly but bind is user intuition friendly. Another option is
-- to have other functions with a different argument order e.g. flippedCross
-- instead of cross.
--
-- If we change the order we have to make sure that we have a consistent
-- convention for set-like and the cross join operations.

-- TODO: OrdSet/IntSet/hashmap based versions of these. With Eq only
-- constraint, the best would be to use an Array with linear search. If the
-- second stream is sorted we can also use a binary search, using Ord
-- constraint or an ordering function.
--
-- For Storables we can cache the second stream into an unboxed array for
-- possibly faster access/compact representation?
--
-- If we do not want to keep the stream in memory but always read it from the
-- source (disk/network) every time we iterate through it then we can do that
-- too by reading the stream every time, the stream must have immutable state
-- in that case and the user is responsible for the behavior if the stream
-- source changes during iterations. We can also use an Unfold instead of
-- stream. We probably need a way to distinguish streams that can be read
-- mutliple times without any interference (e.g. unfolding a stream using an
-- immutable handle would work i.e. using pread/pwrite instead of maintaining
-- an offset in the handle).

-- XXX We can do this concurrently.
-- XXX If the second stream is sorted and passed as an Array we could use
-- binary search if we have an Ord instance or Ordering returning function. The
-- time complexity would then become (m x log n).

-- | Like 'cross' but emits only those tuples where @a == b@ using the supplied
-- equality predicate. This is essentially a @cross intersection@ of two

--
-- Definition:
--
-- >>> innerJoin eq s1 s2 = Stream.filter (\(a, b) -> a `eq` b) $ Stream.cross s1 s2
--
-- The second (inner) stream must be finite. Moreover, it must be either pure
-- or capable of multiple evaluations. If not then the caller should cache it
-- in an 'Data.Array.Array', if the type does not have an 'Unbox' instance then
-- use the Generic 'Data.Array.Generic.Array'. Convert the array to stream
-- before calling this function. Caching may also improve performance if the
-- stream is expensive to evaluate.
--
-- If you care about performance this function should be your last choice among
-- all inner joins. 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Unfold.innerJoin' is a much faster
-- fused alternative. 'innerSortedJoin' is a faster alternative when streams
-- are sorted. 'innerOrdJoin' is an order of magnitude faster alternative when
-- the type has an 'Ord' instance.
--
-- Note: Conceptually, this is a commutative operation. Result includes all the
-- elements from the left and the right stream. The order of streams can be
-- changed without affecting results, except for the ordering within the tuple.
