-- = Stream Consumers
--
-- We can classify stream consumers in the following categories in order of
-- increasing complexity and power:
--
-- * Accumulators: Tee/Zip is simple, cannot be appended, good for scanning.
-- * Terminating folds: Tee/Zip varies based on termination, can be appended,
--   good for scanning, nesting (many) is easy.
-- * Non-failing (backtracking only) parsers: cannot be used as scans because
--   of backtracking, nesting is complicated because of backtracking, appending
--   is efficient because of no Alternative, Alternative does not make sense
--   because it cannot fail.
-- * Parsers: Alternative on failure, appending is not as efficient because of
--   buffering for Alternative.
--
-- First two are represented by the 'Fold' type and the last two by the
-- 'Parser' type.
--
-- == Folds that never terminate (Accumulators)
--
-- An @Accumulator@ is the simplest type of fold, it never fails and never
-- terminates. It can always accept more inputs (never terminates) and the
-- accumulator is always valid.  For example 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Fold.sum'.
-- Traditional Haskell left folds like 'foldl' are accumulators.
--
-- Accumulators can be composed in parallel where we distribute the input
-- stream to all accumulators.  Since accumulators never terminate they cannot
-- be appended.
--
-- An accumulator can be represented as:
--
-- @
-- data Fold0 m a b =
--   forall s. Fold0
--      (s -> a -> m s) -- step
--      (m s)           -- initial
--      (s -> m b)      -- extract
-- @
--
-- This is just a traditional left fold, compare with @foldl@. The driver of
-- the fold would call @initial@ at the beginning and then keep accumulating
-- inputs into its result using @step@ and finally extract the result using
-- @extract@.
--
-- == Folds that terminate after one or more input
--
-- @Terminating folds@ are accumulators that can terminate, like accumulators
-- they do not fail. Once a fold terminates it no longer accepts any more
-- inputs.  Terminating folds can be appended, the next fold can be
-- applied after the first one terminates.  Because they cannot fail, they do
-- not need backtracking.
--
-- The 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Fold.take' operation is an example of a
-- terminating fold. It terminates after consuming @n@ items. Coupled with an
-- accumulator (e.g. sum) it can be used to process the stream into chunks of
-- fixed size.
--
-- A terminating fold can be represented as:
--
-- @
-- data Step s b
--     = Partial !s -- the fold can accept more input
--     | Done !b    -- the fold is done
--
-- data Fold1 m a b =
--   forall s. Fold1
--      (s -> a -> m (Step s b)) -- step
--      (m s)                    -- initial
--      (s -> m b)               -- extract
-- @
--
-- The fold driver stops driving the fold as soon as the fold returns a @Done@.
-- @extract@ is required only if the fold has not stopped yet and the input
-- ends. @extract@ can never be called if the fold is @Done@.
--
-- Notice that the @initial@ of `Fold1` type does not return a "Step" type,
-- therefore, it cannot say "Done" in initial. It always has to consume at
-- least one element before it can say "Done" for termination, via the @step@
-- function.
--
-- == Folds that terminate after 0 or more input
--
-- The `Fold1` type makes combinators like @take 0@ impossible to implement
-- because they need to terminate even before they can consume any elements at
-- all.  Implementing this requires the @initial@ function to be able to return
-- @Done@.
--
-- @
-- data Fold m a b =
--   forall s. Fold
--      (s -> a -> m (Step s b)) -- step
--      (m (Step s b))           -- initial
--      (s -> m b)               -- extract
-- @
--
-- This is also required if we want to compose terminating folds using an
-- Applicative or Monadic composition. @pure@ needs to yield an output without
-- having to consume an input.
--
-- @initial@ now has the ability to terminate the fold without consuming any
-- input based on the state of the monad.
--
-- In some cases it does not make sense to use a fold that does not consume any
-- items at all, and it may even lead to an infinite loop. It might make sense
-- to use a `Fold1` type for such cases because it guarantees to consume at
-- least one input, therefore, guarantees progress. For example, in
-- classifySessionsBy or any other splitting operations it may not make sense
-- to pass a fold that never consumes an input. However, we do not have a
-- separate Fold1 type for the sake of simplicity of types/API.
--
-- Adding this capability adds a certain amount of complexity in the
-- implementation of fold combinators. @initial@ has to always handle two cases
-- now.  We could potentially not implement this in folds to keep fold
-- implementation simpler, and these use cases can be transferred to the parser
-- type. However, it would be a bit inconvenient to not have a `take` operation
-- or to not be able to use `take 0` if we have it. Also, applicative and
-- monadic composition of folds would not be possible.
--
-- == Cleanup Action
--
-- Fold may use other folds in the downstream pipeline. When a fold is done and
-- it wants to terminate it needs to wait for the downstream folds before it
-- returns. For example, if the downstream fold is an async fold we need to
-- wait for the async fold to finish and return the final result.
--
-- To be able to support this use case we need a cleanup action in the fold.
-- The fold gets finalized once the cleanup is called and we can use extract to
-- get the final state/result of the fold.
--
-- Similar to folds we may have a cleanup action in streams as well. Currently,
-- we rely on GC to cleanup the streams, if we use a cleanup action then we can
-- perform cleanup quickly. Also, similar to folds we can also have an
-- "initial" action in streams as well to generate the initial state. It could
-- decouple the initialization of the stream from the first element being
-- pulled. For example, you may want to start a timer at initialization rather
-- than at the first element pull of the stream.
--
-- == Terminating Folds with backtracking
--
-- Consider the example of @takeWhile@ operation, it needs to inspect an
-- element for termination decision. However, it does not consume the element
-- on which it terminates. To implement @takeWhile@ a terminating fold will
-- have to implement a way to return the unconsumed input to the fold driver.
--
-- Single element leftover case is quite common and its easy to implement it in
-- terminating folds by adding a @Done1@ constructor in the 'Step' type which
-- indicates that the last element was not consumed by the fold. The following
-- additional operations can be implemented as terminating folds if we do that.
--
-- @
-- takeWhile
-- groupBy
-- wordBy
-- @
--
-- However, it creates several complications. The most important one is that we
-- cannot use such folds for scanning. We cannot backtrack after producing an
-- output in a scan.
--
-- === Nested backtracking
--
-- Nesting of backtracking folds increases the amount of backtracking required
-- exponentially.
--
-- For example, the combinator @many inner outer@ applies the outer fold on the
-- input stream and applies the inner fold on the results of the outer fold.
--
-- many :: Monad m => Fold m b c -> Fold m a b -> Fold m a c
--
-- If the inner fold itself returns a @Done1@ then we need to backtrack all
-- the elements that have been consumed by the outer fold to generate that
-- value. We need backtracking of more than one element.
--
-- Arbitrary backtracking requires arbitrary buffering. However, we do not want
-- to buffer unconditionally, only if the buffer is needed. One way to do this
-- is to use a "Continue" constructor like parsers. When we have nested folds,
-- the top level fold always returns a "Continue" to the driver until an output
-- is generated by it, this means the top level driver keeps buffering until an
-- output is generated via Partial or Done. Intermediate level "Continue" keep
-- propagating up to the top level.
--
-- === Parallel backtracking
--
-- In compositions like Alternative and Distributive we may have several
-- branches. Each branch can backtrack independently. We need to keep the input
-- as long as any of the branches need it. We can use a single copy of the
-- buffer and maintain it based on all the branches, or we can make each branch
-- have its own buffer. The latter approach may be simpler to implement.
-- Whenever we branch we can introduce an independent buffer for backtracking.
-- Or we can use a newtype that allows branched composition to handle
-- backtracking.
--
-- === Implementation Approach
--
-- To avoid these issues we can enforce, by using types, that the collecting
-- folds can never return a leftover.  This leads us to define a type that can
-- never return a leftover. The use cases of single leftover can be transferred
-- to parsers where we have general backtracking mechanism and single leftover
-- is just a special case of backtracking.
--
-- This means: takeWhile, groupBy, wordBy would be implemented as parsers.
--
-- A proposed design is to use the same Step type with Error in Folds as well
-- as Parsers. Folds won't use the Error constructor and even if they use, it
-- will be equivalent to just throwing an error. They won't have an
-- alternative.
--
-- Because of the complexity of implementing a distributive composition in
-- presence of backtracking we could possibly have a type without backtracking
-- but with the "Continue" constructor, and use either the Parser type or
-- another type for backtracking.
--
-- == Folds with an additional input
--
-- The `Fold` type does not allow a dynamic input to be used to generate the
-- initial value of the fold accumulator. We can extend the type further to
-- allow that:
--
-- @
-- data Refold m i a b =
--   forall s. Refold
--      (s -> a -> m (Step s b)) -- step
--      (i -> m (Step s b))      -- initial
--      (s -> m b)               -- extract
-- @
--
-- == Parsers
--
-- The next upgrade after terminating folds with a leftover are parsers.
-- Parsers are terminating folds that can fail and backtrack. Parsers can be
-- composed using an @alternative@ style composition where they can backtrack
-- and apply another parser if one parser fails.
-- 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Parser.satisfy' is a simple example of a parser, it
-- would succeed if the condition is satisfied and it would fail otherwise, on
-- failure an alternative parser can be used on the same input.
--
-- We add @Error@ and @Continue@ to the @Step@ type of fold. @Continue@ is to
-- skip producing an output or to backtrack. We also add the ability to
-- backtrack in @Partial@ and @Done@.:
--
-- Also @extract@ now needs to be able to express an error. We could have it
-- return the @Step@ type as well but that makes the implementation more
-- complicated.
--
-- @
-- data Step s b =
--       Partial Int s   -- partial result and how much to backtrack
--     | Done Int b      -- final result and how much to backtrack
--     | Continue Int s  -- no result and how much to backtrack
--     | Error String    -- error
--
-- data Parser a m b =
--   forall s. Fold
--      (s -> a -> m (Step s b))   -- step
--      (m (Step s b))             -- initial
--      (s -> m (Either String b)) -- extract
-- @
--
-- = Types for Stream Consumers
--
-- We do not have a separate type for accumulators. Terminating folds are a
-- superset of accumulators and to avoid too many types we represent both using
-- the same type, 'Fold'.
--
-- We do not club the leftovers functionality with terminating folds because of
-- the reasons explained earlier. Instead combinators that require leftovers
-- are implemented as the 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Parser.Parser' type.  This is
-- a sweet spot to balance ease of use, type safety and performance.  Using
-- separate Accumulator and terminating fold types would encode more
-- information in types but it would make ease of use, implementation,
-- maintenance effort worse. Combining Accumulator, terminating folds and
-- Parser into a single 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Parser.Parser' type would make
-- ease of use even better but type safety and performance worse.
--
-- One of the design requirements that we have placed for better ease of use
-- and code reuse is that 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Parser.Parser' type should be
-- a strict superset of the 'Fold' type i.e. it can do everything that a 'Fold'
-- can do and more. Therefore, folds can be easily upgraded to parsers and we
-- can use parser combinators on folds as well when needed.
--
-- = Fold Design
--
-- A fold is represented by a collection of "initial", "step" and "extract"
-- functions. The "initial" action generates the initial state of the fold. The
-- state is internal to the fold and maintains the accumulated output. The
-- "step" function is invoked using the current state and the next input value
-- and results in a @Partial@ or @Done@. A @Partial@ returns the next intermediate
-- state of the fold, a @Done@ indicates that the fold has terminated and
-- returns the final value of the accumulator.
--
-- Every @Partial@ indicates that a new accumulated output is available.  The
-- accumulated output can be extracted from the state at any point using
-- "extract". "extract" can never fail. A fold returns a valid output even
-- without any input i.e. even if you call "extract" on "initial" state it
-- provides an output. This is not true for parsers.
--
-- In general, "extract" is used in two cases:
--
-- * When the fold is used as a scan @extract@ is called on the intermediate
-- state every time it is yielded by the fold, the resulting value is yielded
-- as a stream.
-- * When the fold is used as a regular fold, @extract@ is called once when
-- we are done feeding input to the fold.
--
-- = Alternate Designs
--
-- An alternate and simpler design would be to return the intermediate output
-- via @Partial@ along with the state, instead of using "extract" on the yielded
-- state and remove the extract function altogether.
--
-- This may even facilitate more efficient implementation.  Extract from the
-- intermediate state after each yield may be more costly compared to the fold
-- step itself yielding the output. The fold may have more efficient ways to
-- retrieve the output rather than stuffing it in the state and using extract
-- on the state.
--
-- However, removing extract altogether may lead to less optimal code in some
-- cases because the driver of the fold needs to thread around the intermediate
-- output to return it if the stream stops before the fold could return @Done@.
-- When using this approach, the @parseMany (FL.take filesize)@ benchmark shows
-- a 2x worse performance even after ensuring everything fuses.  So we keep the
-- "extract" approach to ensure better perf in all cases.
--
-- But we could still yield both state and the output in @Partial@, the output
-- can be used for the scan use case, instead of using extract. Extract would
-- then be used only for the case when the stream stops before the fold
-- completes.
--
-- = Monoids
--
-- Monoids allow generalized, modular folding.  The accumulators in this module
-- can be expressed using 'mconcat' and a suitable 'Monoid'.  Instead of
-- writing folds we can write Monoids and turn them into folds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The Fold type
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- An fold is akin to a writer. It is the streaming equivalent of a writer.
-- The type @b@ is the accumulator of the writer. That's the reason the
-- default folds in various modules are called "write".

-- An alternative to using an "extract" function is to use "Partial s b" style
-- partial value so that we always emit the output value and there is no need
-- to extract. Then extract can be used for cleanup purposes. But in this case
-- in some cases we may need a "Continue" constructor where an output value is
-- not available, this was implicit earlier. Also, "b" should be lazy here so
-- that we do not always compute it even if we do not need it.
--
-- Partial s b  --> extract :: s -> b
-- Continue     --> extract :: s -> Maybe b
--
-- But keeping 'b' lazy does not let the fold optimize well. It leads to
-- significant regressions in the key-value folds.
--
-- The "final" function complicates combinators that take other folds as
-- argument because we need to call their finalizers at right places. An
-- alternative to reduce this complexity where it is not required is to use a
-- separate type for bracketed folds but then we need to manage the complexity
-- of two different fold types.

-- The "final" function could be (s -> m (Step s b)), like in parsers so that
-- it can be called in a loop to drain the fold.

-- | The type @Fold m a b@ represents a consumer of an input stream of values
-- of type @a@ and returning a final value of type @b@ in 'Monad' @m@. The
-- constructor of a fold is @Fold step initial extract final@.
--
-- The fold uses an internal state of type @s@. The initial value of the state
-- @s@ is created by @initial@. This function is called once and only once
-- before the fold starts consuming input. Any resource allocation can be done
-- in this function.
--
-- The @step@ function is called on each input, it consumes an input and
-- returns the next intermediate state (see 'Step') or the final result @b@ if
-- the fold terminates.
--
-- If the fold is used as a scan, the @extract@ function is used by the scan
-- driver to map the current state @s@ of the fold to the fold result. Thus
-- @extract@ can be called multiple times. In some folds, where scanning does
-- not make sense, this function is left unimplemented; such folds cannot be
-- used as scans.
--
-- Before a fold terminates, @final@ is called once and only once (unless the
-- fold terminated in @initial@ itself). Any resources allocated by @initial@
-- can be released in @final@. In folds that do not require any cleanup
-- @extract@ and @final@ are typically the same.
--
-- When implementing fold combinators, care should be taken to cleanup any
-- state of the argument folds held by the fold by calling the respective
-- @final@ at all exit points of the fold. Also, @final@ should not be called
-- more than once. Note that if a fold terminates by 'Done' constructor, there
-- is no state to cleanup.
--
-- NOTE: The constructor is not yet released, smart constructors are provided
-- to create folds.

-- XXX These are singleton folds that are closed for input. The correspondence

-- does not produce any accumulator value. However, we do not have a
-- representation of an empty value in folds, because the Done constructor
-- always produces a value (Done b). We can potentially use "Partial s b" and
-- "Done" to make the type correspond to the stream type. That may be possible
-- if we introduce the "Skip" constructor as well because after the last
-- "Partial s b" we have to emit a "Skip to Done" state to keep cranking the
-- fold until it is done.
--
-- There is also the asymmetry between folds and streams because folds have an
-- "initial" to initialize the fold without any input. A similar concept is
-- possible in streams as well to stop the stream. That would be a "closing"
-- operation for the stream which can be called even without consuming any item
-- from the stream or when we are done consuming.
--
-- However, the initial action in folds creates a discrepancy with the CPS
-- folds, and the same may be the case if we have a stop/cleanup operation in
-- streams.

-- or if the input stream is over, the outputs of the two folds are combined
-- using the supplied function.
--
-- Example:
--
-- >>> header = Fold.take 8 Fold.toList
-- >>> line = Fold.takeEndBy (== '\n') Fold.toList
-- >>> f = Fold.splitWith (,) header line
-- >>> Stream.fold f $ Stream.fromList "header: hello\n"

--
-- Note: This is dual to appending streams using 'Data.Stream.append'.
--
-- Note: this implementation allows for stream fusion but has quadratic time
-- complexity, because each composition adds a new branch that each subsequent
-- fold's input element has to traverse, therefore, it cannot scale to a large
-- number of compositions. After around 100 compositions the performance starts
-- dipping rapidly compared to a CPS style implementation.

-- For larger number of compositions you can convert the fold to a parser and
