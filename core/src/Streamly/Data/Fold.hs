--
-- A 'Fold' is a sink or a consumer of a stream of values.  The 'Fold' type
-- consists of an accumulator and an effectful action that absorbs a value into
-- the accumulator.
--
-- >>> import Data.Function ((&))
-- >>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Fold as Fold
-- >>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Stream as Stream
--
-- For example, a 'sum' Fold represents adding the input to the accumulated
-- sum.  A fold driver e.g. 'Streamly.Prelude.fold' pushes values from a stream
-- to the 'Fold' one at a time, reducing the stream to a single value.
--
-- >>> Stream.fold Fold.sum $ Stream.fromList [1..100]
-- 5050
--
-- Conceptually, a 'Fold' is a data type that can mimic a strict left fold
-- ('Data.List.foldl') as well as lazy right fold ('Prelude.foldr').  The above
-- example is similar to a left fold using @(+)@ as the step and @0@ as the
-- initial value of the accumulator:
--
-- >>> Data.List.foldl' (+) 0 [1..100]
-- 5050
--
-- 'Fold's have an early termination capability e.g. the 'one' fold would
-- terminate on an infinite stream:
--
-- >>> Stream.fold Fold.one $ Stream.fromList [1..]
-- Just 1
--
-- The above example is similar to the following right fold:
--
-- >>> Prelude.foldr (\x _ -> Just x) Nothing [1..]
-- Just 1
--
-- 'Fold's can be combined together using combinators. For example, to create a
-- fold that sums first two elements in a stream:
--
-- >>> sumTwo = Fold.take 2 Fold.sum
-- >>> Stream.fold sumTwo $ Stream.fromList [1..100]
-- 3
--
-- Folds can be combined to run in parallel on the same input. For example, to
-- compute the average of numbers in a stream without going through the stream
-- twice:
--
-- >>> avg = Fold.teeWith (/) Fold.sum (fmap fromIntegral Fold.length)
-- >>> Stream.fold avg $ Stream.fromList [1.0..100.0]
-- 50.5
--
-- Folds can be combined so as to partition the input stream over multiple
-- folds. For example, to count even and odd numbers in a stream:
--
-- >>> split n = if even n then Left n else Right n
-- >>> stream = fmap split $ Stream.fromList [1..100]
-- >>> countEven = fmap (("Even " ++) . show) Fold.length
-- >>> countOdd = fmap (("Odd "  ++) . show) Fold.length
-- >>> f = Fold.partition countEven countOdd
-- >>> Stream.fold f stream
-- ("Even 50","Odd 50")
--
-- Terminating folds can be combined to parse the stream serially such that the
-- first fold consumes the input until it terminates and the second fold
-- consumes the rest of the input until it terminates:
--
-- >>> f = Fold.serialWith (,) (Fold.take 8 Fold.toList) (Fold.takeEndBy (== '\n') Fold.toList)
-- >>> Stream.fold f $ Stream.fromList "header: hello\n"
-- ("header: ","hello\n")
--
-- A 'Fold' can be applied repeatedly on a stream to transform it to a stream
-- of fold results. To split a stream on newlines:
--
-- >>> f = Fold.takeEndBy (== '\n') Fold.toList
-- >>> Stream.fold Fold.toList $ Stream.foldMany f $ Stream.fromList "Hello there!\nHow are you\n"
-- ["Hello there!\n","How are you\n"]
--
-- Similarly, we can split the input of a fold too:
--
-- >>> Stream.fold (Fold.many f Fold.toList) $ Stream.fromList "Hello there!\nHow are you\n"
-- ["Hello there!\n","How are you\n"]
--
-- Please see "Streamly.Internal.Data.Fold" for additional @Pre-release@
-- functions.
--
-- = Folds vs. Streams
--
-- We can often use streams or folds to achieve the same goal. However, streams
-- are more efficient in composition of producers (e.g.
-- 'Streamly.Prelude.serial' or 'Streamly.Prelude.mergeBy') whereas folds are
-- more efficient in composition of consumers (e.g.  'serialWith', 'partition'
-- or 'teeWith').
--
-- Streams are producers, transformations on streams happen on the output side:
--
-- >>> :{
--  f stream =
--        Stream.filter odd stream
--      & fmap (+1)
--      & Stream.fold Fold.sum
-- :}
--
-- >>> f $ Stream.fromList [1..100 :: Int]
-- 2550
--
-- Folds are stream consumers with an input stream and an output value, stream
-- transformations on folds happen on the input side:
--
-- >>> :{
-- f =
--        Fold.filter odd
--      $ Fold.lmap (+1)
--      $ Fold.sum
-- :}
--
-- >>> Stream.fold f $ Stream.fromList [1..100 :: Int]
-- 2550
--
-- Notice the similiarity in the definition of @f@ in both cases, the only
-- difference is the composition by @&@ vs @$@ and the use @lmap@ vs @map@, the
-- difference is due to output vs input side transformations.

    -- | Folds that never terminate, these folds are much like strict left
    -- folds. 'mconcat' is the fundamental accumulator.  All other accumulators
    -- can be expressed in terms of 'mconcat' using a suitable Monoid.  Instead
    -- of writing folds we could write Monoids and turn them into folds.

    -- * Combinators
    -- | Combinators are modifiers of folds.  In the type @Fold m a b@, @a@ is
    -- the input type and @b@ is the output type.  Transformations can be
    -- applied either on the input side or on the output side.  Therefore,
    -- combinators are of one of the following general shapes:
    --
    -- * @... -> Fold m a b -> Fold m c b@ (input transformation)
    -- * @... -> Fold m a b -> Fold m a c@ (output transformation)
    --
    -- Output transformations are also known as covariant transformations, and
    -- input transformations are also known as contravariant transformations.
    -- The input side transformations are more interesting for folds.  Most of
    -- the following sections describe the input transformation operations on a
    -- fold.  The names and signatures of the operations are consistent with
    -- corresponding operations in "Streamly.Prelude". When an operation makes
    -- sense on both input and output side we use the prefix @l@ (for left) for
    -- input side operations and the prefix @r@ (for right) for output side
    -- operations.

    -- ** Mapping on output
    -- | The 'Functor' instance of a fold maps on the output of the fold:
    --
