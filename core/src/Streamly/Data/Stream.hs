--
-- To run examples in this module:
--
-- >>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Fold as Fold
-- >>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Stream as Stream
--
-- We will add some more imports in the examples as needed.
--
-- For effectful streams we will use the following IO action:
--
-- >>> effect n = print n >> return n
--
-- = Overview
--
-- Streamly is a framework for modular data flow based programming and
-- declarative concurrency.  Powerful stream fusion framework in streamly
-- allows high performance combinatorial programming even when using byte level
-- streams.  Streamly API is similar to Haskell lists.
--
-- Streams can be constructed like lists, except that they use 'nil' instead of
-- '[]' and 'cons' instead of ':'.
--
-- `cons` adds a pure value at the head of the stream:
--
-- >>> import Streamly.Data.Stream (Stream, cons, consM, nil)
-- >>> stream = 1 `cons` 2 `cons` nil :: Stream IO Int
-- >>> Stream.fold Fold.toList stream -- IO [Int]
-- [1,2]
--
-- `consM` adds an effect at the head of the stream:
--
-- >>> stream = effect 1 `consM` effect 2 `consM` nil
-- >>> Stream.fold Fold.toList stream
-- 1
-- 2
-- [1,2]
--
-- == Console Echo Example
--
-- In the following example, 'repeatM' generates an infinite stream of 'String'
-- by repeatedly performing the 'getLine' IO action. 'mapM' then applies
-- 'putStrLn' on each element in the stream converting it to stream of '()'.
-- Finally, 'drain' folds the stream to IO discarding the () values, thus
-- producing only effects.
--
-- >>> import Data.Function ((&))
--
-- >>> :{
-- echo =
--  Stream.repeatM getLine       -- Stream IO String
--      & Stream.mapM putStrLn   -- Stream IO ()
--      & Stream.fold Fold.drain -- IO ()
-- :}
--
-- This is a console echo program. It is an example of a declarative loop
-- written using streaming combinators.  Compare it with an imperative @while@
-- loop.
--
-- Hopefully, this gives you an idea how we can program declaratively by
-- representing loops using streams. In this module, you can find all
-- "Data.List" like functions and many more powerful combinators to perform
-- common programming tasks.
--
-- == Useful Idioms
--
-- >>> fromListM = Stream.sequence . Stream.fromList
-- >>> fromFoldableM = Stream.sequence . Stream.fromFoldable
-- >>> fromIndices f = fmap f $ Stream.enumerateFrom 0
--
-- Also see "Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream" module for many more @Pre-release@
-- combinators. See the <https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples>
-- repository for many more real world examples of stream programming.

    -- ** Enumeration
    -- | We can use the 'Enum' type class to enumerate a type producing a list
    -- and then convert it to a stream:

    -- @
    -- 'fromList' $ 'Prelude.enumFromThen' from then
    -- @
    --
    -- However, this is not particularly efficient.
    -- The 'Enumerable' type class provides corresponding functions that
    -- generate a stream instead of a list, efficiently.

    -- * Elimination
    -- | Functions ending in the general shape @Stream m a -> m b@ or @Stream m
    -- a -> m (b, Stream m a)@
    --
    -- See also: "Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.Eliminate" for @Pre-release@
    -- functions.

-- EXPLANATION: In imperative terms a fold can be considered as a loop over the stream
-- that reduces the stream to a single value.
-- Left and right folds both use a fold function @f@ and an identity element
-- @z@ (@zero@) to deconstruct a recursive data structure and reconstruct a
-- new data structure. The new structure may be a recursive construction (a
-- container) or a non-recursive single value reduction of the original
-- structure.
--
-- Both right and left folds are mathematical duals of each other, they are
-- functionally equivalent.  Operationally, a left fold on a left associated
-- structure behaves exactly in the same way as a right fold on a right
-- associated structure. Similarly, a left fold on a right associated structure
-- behaves in the same way as a right fold on a left associated structure.
-- However, the behavior of a right fold on a right associated structure is
-- operationally different (even though functionally equivalent) than a left
-- fold on the same structure.
--
-- On right associated structures like Haskell @cons@ lists or Streamly
-- streams, a lazy right fold is naturally suitable for lazy recursive
-- reconstruction of a new structure, while a strict left fold is naturally
-- suitable for efficient reduction. In right folds control is in the hand of
-- the @puller@ whereas in left folds the control is in the hand of the
-- @pusher@.
--
-- The behavior of right and left folds are described in detail in the
-- individual fold's documentation.  To illustrate the two folds for right
-- associated @cons@ lists:
--
-- > foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
-- > foldr f z [] = z
-- > foldr f z (x:xs) = x `f` foldr f z xs
-- >
-- > foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
-- > foldl f z [] = z
-- > foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (z `f` x) xs
--
-- @foldr@ is conceptually equivalent to:
--
-- > foldr f z [] = z
-- > foldr f z [x] = f x z
-- > foldr f z xs = foldr f (foldr f z (tail xs)) [head xs]
--
-- @foldl@ is conceptually equivalent to:
--
-- > foldl f z [] = z
-- > foldl f z [x] = f z x
-- > foldl f z xs = foldl f (foldl f z (init xs)) [last xs]
--
-- Left and right folds are duals of each other.
--
-- @
-- foldr f z xs = foldl (flip f) z (reverse xs)
-- foldl f z xs = foldr (flip f) z (reverse xs)
-- @
--
-- More generally:
--
-- @
-- foldr f z xs = foldl g id xs z where g k x = k . f x
-- foldl f z xs = foldr g id xs z where g x k = k . flip f x
-- @
--

-- NOTE: Folds are inherently serial as each step needs to use the result of
-- the previous step. However, it is possible to fold parts of the stream in
-- parallel and then combine the results using a monoid.

    -- -- ** Lazy Right Folds
    -- Consuming a stream to build a right associated expression, suitable
    -- for lazy evaluation. Evaluation of the input happens when the output of
    -- the fold is evaluated, the fold output is a lazy thunk.
    --
    -- This is suitable for stream transformation operations, for example,
    -- operations like mapping a function over the stream.

    -- , foldr

    -- * Mapping
    -- | Stateless one-to-one transformations. Use 'fmap' for mapping a pure
    -- function on a stream.

    -- EXPLANATION:
    -- In imperative terms a map operation can be considered as a loop over
    -- the stream that transforms the stream into another stream by performing
    -- an operation on each element of the stream.
    --
    -- 'map' is the least powerful transformation operation with strictest
    -- guarantees.  A map, (1) is a stateless loop which means that no state is
    -- allowed to be carried from one iteration to another, therefore,
    -- operations on different elements are guaranteed to not affect each
    -- other, (2) is a strictly one-to-one transformation of stream elements
    -- which means it guarantees that no elements can be added or removed from
    -- the stream, it can merely transform them.

    -- * Filtering
    -- | Remove elements from the stream.

    -- ** Stateless Filters
    -- | 'mapMaybeM' is the most general stateless filtering operation. All
    -- other filtering operations can be expressed using it.

    -- EXPLANATION:
    -- In imperative terms a filter over a stream corresponds to a loop with a
    -- @continue@ clause for the cases when the predicate fails.

    -- perform stateful filtering operations in general.

    -- | Merging of @n@ streams can be performed by combining the streams pair

    -- O(n * log n) time complexity.

    -- * Stream of streams
    -- | Stream operations like map and filter represent loop processing in
    -- imperative programming terms. Similarly, the imperative concept of
    -- nested loops are represented by streams of streams. The 'concatMap'
    -- operation represents nested looping.
    -- A 'concatMap' operation loops over the input stream and then for each
    -- element of the input stream generates another stream and then loops over
    -- that inner stream as well producing effects and generating a single
    -- output stream.
    --
    -- One dimension loops are just a special case of nested loops.  For
    -- example, 'concatMap' can degenerate to a simple map operation:
    --
    -- > map f m = S.concatMap (\x -> S.fromPure (f x)) m
    --
    -- Similarly, 'concatMap' can perform filtering by mapping an element to a
    -- 'nil' stream:
    --
    -- > filter p m = S.concatMap (\x -> if p x then S.fromPure x else S.nil) m

    -- * Exceptions

    -- stream of arrays before flattening it to a stream of chars.
