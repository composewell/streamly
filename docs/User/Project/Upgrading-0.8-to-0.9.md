# Upgrading to streamly 0.9.0

Also see the detailed changelog describing all the changes in the release:

* [0.9.0 API Changelog](/docs/User/Project/ApiChangelogs/0.8.3-0.9.0.txt) or
* [0.9.0 API Changelog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly-0.9.0/docs/docs/User/ProjectRelated/ApiChangelogs/0.8.3-0.9.0.txt)

`Streamly.Prelude` module has been deprecated, equivalent
functionality is covered by the `Streamly.Data.Stream`,
`Streamly.Data.Stream.Prelude`, and `Streamly.Data.Fold` modules. The
new modules use a monomorphic `Stream` type instead of the polymorphic
`IsStream t` type.

`Streamly.Data.Stream` module and the `Stream` type are designed
for writing high-performance fused pipelines not involving explicit
recursion. For writing code that may require recursive function calls,
`Streamly.Data.Stream.StreamK` module and the `StreamK` type have been
introduced which provide a CPS based stream implementation. `Stream` and
`StreamK` types can be easily interconverted. These changes have been made to
make performance robust and not rely on GHC rewrite rules which could be
fragile. For example, GHC 9.0.x had broken the rewrite rule which was
not fixed until GHC-9.2.2. This split also gives more power and
transparency of the performance behavior to the programmer.

Instead of using separate stream types for concurrent code, now
you have to use explicit concurrent combinators with appropriate
concurrency parameters. These combinators are available in the
`Streamly.Data.Stream.Prelude` module. This change has been made to allow
programmers to control concurrent behavior in a more robust way and
reduce pitfalls.

The old code can be adapted to use the new modules with some
changes. More details about this is supplied in the following sections.
Please open an issue if you cannot find a way to adapt the code to the new
release.

Assume the following imports in the code snippets below:

```haskell docspec
>>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Stream as Stream
>>> import qualified Streamly.Data.StreamK as StreamK
>>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Stream.Prelude as Stream
>>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Fold as Fold
>>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Parser as Parser
```

## Dependencies in cabal file

If you allow streamly < 0.9 in version bounds in your package then you
may not be able to build if any of the following is true:

* there is a dependency on `streamly-core` (module name conflicts)
* there is a dependency on `streamly-bytestring` >= 0.2 (type conflict)

You can define and use a build flag in your package to allow older
streamly versions:

```
flag old-streamly
  description: Allow streamly versions lower than 0.9
  manual: True
  default: False
```

```
  if flag(old-streamly)
    build-depends:
      streamly >=0.8.3 && < 0.9
  else
    build-depends:
      streamly-core >= 0.1.0 && < 0.2,
      streamly >=0.9.0 && < 0.10
```

## The `Stream` and `StreamK` types

The following types are removed:

* `IsStream`
* `ZipSerialM`
* `ZipAsyncM`
* `WSerialT`
* `WAsyncT`
* `SerialT`
* `ParallelT`
* `AsyncT`
* `AheadT`

In the new release, the `Stream` type is the primary stream type that
you will use most of the time. You can think of it as a replacement for
the `SerialT` type. However, it does not provide an Applicative or Monad
instance.

The `CrossStream` type in `Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream` is a
wrapper over `Stream` type supplying the Monad instance. However, see
the "Stream Fusion" section in the `Streamly.Data.Stream` module for
limitations of the `Stream` type. The `StreamK` type and `CrossStreamK`
(in Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.StreamK) could be used to overcome the
limitations of `Stream` type.

If required, you can use the template-haskell functions in
`Streamly.Data.Stream.MkType` to create stream type wrappers (like
ZipSerialM or WSerialT) with custom Applicative or Monadic properties.
But in general, try to avoid specific types and use explicit functions
from the stream module.

Here are the TH macro based recipes to define types equivalent to all the older
types:

```
{-# LANGUAGE StandaloneDeriving #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}
{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}

import Streamly.Data.Stream.MkType
import qualified Streamly.Data.Stream.Prelude as Stream
import qualified Streamly.Internal.Data.StreamK as StreamK
import Language.Haskell.TH
```

`SerialT`: Use `CrossStreamK` from `Streamly.Internal.Data.StreamK` equivalent
Monad and other instances.

For `WSerialT`, create a newtype wrapper using the following monad bind
operation:

```
bind = StreamK.bindWith StreamK.interleave
```

`WSerialT` requires `StreamK`, therefore you can not generate the code directly
using TH macros. However, you can print the code generated by the TH macro.
Then you can tweak that code, replacing `Stream` type with `StreamK`.

```
expr <- runQ (mkCrossType "WSerialT" "bind" True)
putStrLn $ pprint expr
```

For `AsyncT`:

```
bind = flip (Stream.parConcatMap id)
$(mkCrossType "AsyncT" "bind" True)
```

For `WAsyncT`:

```
bind = flip (Stream.parConcatMap (Stream.interleaved True))
$(mkCrossType "WAsyncT" "bind" True)
```

For `AheadT`:

```
bind = flip (Stream.parConcatMap (Stream.ordered True))
$(mkCrossType "AheadT" "bind" True)
```

For `ParallelT`:

```
bind = flip (Stream.parConcatMap (Stream.eager True))
$(mkCrossType "ParallelT" "bind" True)
```

For `ZipSerialM`:

```
apply = Stream.zipWith ($)
$(mkZipType "ZipSerialM" "apply" False)
```

For `ZipAsync`:

```
apply = Stream.parApply id
$(mkZipType "ZipAsync" "apply" False)
```

`adapt` is not needed anymore.

```haskell docspec
>>> (.:) = StreamK.cons
>>> cons = StreamK.cons
>>> wSerial = StreamK.interleave
>>> serial = StreamK.append
>>> fromIndicesM f = Stream.mapM f $ Stream.enumerateFrom 0
>>> fromIndices f = fmap f $ Stream.enumerateFrom 0
>>> fromListM = Stream.sequence . Stream.fromList
>>> fromFoldable = StreamK.toStream . StreamK.fromFoldable
>>> fromFoldableM = Stream.sequence . fromFoldable
```

## Stream folding functions

Explicit stream fold functions have been omitted from the new stream
module. You can use the following equivalent definitions:

```haskell docspec
>>> the = Stream.fold Fold.the
>>> sum = Stream.fold Fold.sum
>>> product = Stream.fold Fold.product
>>> or = Stream.fold Fold.or
>>> null = Stream.fold Fold.null
>>> elemIndex a = Stream.fold (Fold.elemIndex a)
>>> elem a = Stream.fold (Fold.elem a)
>>> notElem a = Stream.fold (Fold.notElem a)
>>> minimumBy ordering = Stream.fold (Fold.minimumBy ordering)
>>> minimum = Stream.fold Fold.minimum
>>> maximumBy ordering = Stream.fold (Fold.maximumBy ordering)
>>> maximum = Stream.fold Fold.maximum
>>> mapM_ f = Stream.fold (Fold.drainMapM f)
>>> lookup a = Stream.fold (Fold.lookup a)
>>> length = Stream.fold Fold.length
>>> last = Stream.fold Fold.latest
>>> head = Stream.fold Fold.one
>>> foldlM' f a = Stream.fold (Fold.foldlM' f a)
>>> foldl1 f = Stream.fold (Fold.foldl1' f)
>>> foldl' f a = Stream.fold (Fold.foldl' f a)
>>> findIndex eq = Stream.fold (Fold.findIndex eq)
>>> find eq = Stream.fold (Fold.find eq)
>>> findM eq = Stream.fold (Fold.findM eq)
>>> drainWhile p = Stream.fold Fold.drain . Stream.takeWhile p
>>> drainN i = Stream.fold Fold.drain . Stream.take i
>>> drain = Stream.fold Fold.drain
>>> any p = Stream.fold (Fold.any p)
>>> and = Stream.fold Fold.and
>>> all p = Stream.fold (Fold.all p)
>>> (!!) i = Stream.fold (Fold.index i)
>>> tail = Streamly.Internal.Data.StreamK.tail
>>> init = Streamly.Internal.Data.StreamK.init
```

Mapping functions:

```haskell docspec
>>> map = fmap
```

Similarly for scanning use `Stream.scan` or `Stream.postscan`
with an appropriate fold.

```haskell docspec
>>> scanl' f z = Stream.scan (Fold.foldl' f z)
>>> scanlM' f z = Stream.scan (Fold.foldlM' f z)
>>> postscanl' f z = Stream.postscan (Fold.foldl' f z)
>>> postscanlM' f z = Stream.postscan (Fold.foldlM' f z)
>>> scanl1' f = Stream.catMaybes . Stream.scan (Fold.foldl1' f)
>>> scanl1M' f = Stream.catMaybes . Stream.scan (Fold.foldlM1' f)
>>> concatMapWith = StreamK.concatMapWith
>>> concatFoldableWith f = Prelude.foldr f StreamK.nil
>>> concatMapFoldableWith f g = Prelude.foldr (f . g) StreamK.nil
>>> concatForFoldableWith f xs g = Prelude.foldr (f . g) StreamK.nil xs
```

Filters:

```haskell docspec
>>> deleteBy cmp x = Stream.scanMaybe (Fold.deleteBy cmp x)
>>> findIndices p = Stream.scanMaybe (Fold.findIndices p)
>>> elemIndices a = findIndices (== a)
```

Custom implementations of most of these folds, scans and filters are also
available in the `Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream` module.

## Stream splitting and grouping functions

Stream splitting and grouping functions like `splitOn`, `wordsBy`, and
`groupsBy` have been omitted from the new stream module as these can
now be implemented using `foldMany` and an appropriate fold from the
`Streamly.Data.Fold` module, or using `parseMany` and an appropriate
parser from the `Streamly.Data.Parser` module.

```haskell docspec
>>> uniq = Stream.scanMaybe (Fold.uniqBy (==))
>>> splitWithSuffix p f = Stream.foldMany (Fold.takeEndBy p f)
>>> splitOn = Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.splitOn
>>> splitOnSuffix p f = Stream.foldMany (Fold.takeEndBy_ p f)
>>> indexedR = Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.indexedR
>>> groupsBy eq fld = Stream.parseMany (Parser.groupBy (flip eq) fld)
>>> groups = groupsBy (==)
>>> groupsByRolling = Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.groupsRollingBy
>>> wordsBy p f = Stream.parseMany (Parser.wordBy p f)
>>> chunksOf n f = Stream.foldMany (Fold.take n f)
```

**Caution**: In `streamly-0.8`, The `groupsBy` comparison function took the new
element as the first argument and the previous element as the second.  The order
is flipped in the newer versions of streamly.

Direct implementation of these are also available in
`Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream`.

## Concurrency

Earlier, concurrent and non-concurrent code used the same
combinators. The code was made concurrent by using different concurrent
stream types such as `AsyncT`, `ParallelT` etc. Now you use the same
stream type everywhere, you have to choose a concurrent combinator
for concurrent behavior.  For example, use `mapM` for serial behavior
and `parMapM` for concurrent behavior. Concurrent combinators can
be imported from `Streamly.Data.Stream.Prelude` module. Concurrent
combinators are prefixed with `par`.

Parallel combinators take a concurrency config argument to specify the
concurrency control parameters.  The following combinators have the same
meaning as before except that they are used to set the config parameters
instead of being applied on the stream:

* `rate`
* `maxRate`
* `constRate`
* `avgRate`
* `minRate`
* `maxThreads`
* `maxBuffer`

A stream is evaluated asynchronously using `parEval`:

```haskell docspec
>>> :set -XFlexibleContexts
>>> mkAsync = Stream.parEval id
```

Earlier `consM` was used to create an implicitly concurrent stream of
actions. In the new release, an equivalent effect is achieved by using
a serial `consM` to create a stream of actions and then explicitly using
`Stream.parEval` on it to evaluate it concurrently.

```haskell docspec
>>> consM = StreamK.consM
>>> (|:) = consM
```

Note that you will have to use `StreamK.toStream` to covert it to `Stream`
before using `parEval` on it.

Existing generation combinators that can be implemented using new primitives:

```haskell docspec
>>> repeatM = Stream.parRepeatM
>>> replicateM = Stream.parReplicateM
>>> unfoldrM step = Stream.parEval id . Stream.unfoldrM step
>>> iterateM step = Stream.parEval id . Stream.iterateM step
>>> fromIndicesM f = Stream.parEval id . fromIndicesM f
>>> fromListM = Stream.parSequence id . Stream.fromList
>>> fromFoldableM = Stream.parSequence id . StreamK.toStream . StreamK.fromFoldable
```

Existing transformation combinators that can be implemented using `parEval`:

```haskell docspec
>>> (|$.) f = f . Stream.parEval id
>>> (|&.) = flip (|$.)
>>> (|$) f = f . Stream.parEval id
>>> (|&) = flip (|$)
>>> sequence = Stream.parSequence
>>> mapM = Stream.parMapM
```

`parList` is used to evaluate multiple streams concurrently and combine the
outputs. Existing combinators that can be implemented using `parList`:

```haskell docspec
>>> async x y = Stream.parList id [x, y]
>>> wAsync x y = Stream.parList (Stream.interleaved True) [x, y]
>>> parallel x y = Stream.parList (Stream.eager True) [x, y]
>>> ahead x y = Stream.parList (Stream.ordered True) [x, y]
```

Concurrent zipping and merging combinators:

```haskell docspec
>>> zipAsyncWithM = Stream.parZipWith id
>>> zipAsyncWith = Stream.parZipWith id
>>> mergeAsyncByM = Stream.parMergeByM id
>>> mergeAsyncBy = Stream.parMergeBy id
```

The equivalent of `concatMapWith` using a concurrent combining operation in the
new release is `parConcatMap`. The config argument in `parConcatMap` can
specify an equivalent of the combining operation. Similarly, concurrent
`concatFoldableWith`, `concatMapFoldableWith`, `concatForFoldableWith` can also
be expressed using `parConcatMap`.
