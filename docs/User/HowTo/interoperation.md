# Interoperation with streaming libraries

We can use `unfoldr` and `uncons` operations to convert one streaming
type to another. See the following interoperation examples in the
[streamly-examples](https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples)
repository.

* [Interoperation with `streaming`](https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples/blob/master/examples/Interop/Streaming.hs)
* [Interoperation with `pipes`](https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples/blob/master/examples/Interop/Pipes.hs)
* [Interoperation with `conduit`](https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples/blob/master/examples/Interop/Conduit.hs)
* [Interoperation with `vector`](https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples/blob/master/examples/Interop/Vector.hs)
