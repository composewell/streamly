# Frequently Asked Questions

This document provides idioms or examples to solve common programming
problems using streamly. To start with please go through [Streamly Quick

This document provides additional examples.

## Distribute and Zip Concurrently

Transform a stream in multiple ways, generating multiple transformed
streams and then zip the corresponding elements of each resulting stream
together to create a single transformed stream.

Distributing a value to a stream of consumers concurrently:

```haskell ghci
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}

import Data.Function ((&))
import qualified Streamly.Data.Fold as Fold
import qualified Streamly.Data.Stream.Prelude as Stream

f1 x =
    Stream.fromList [return . (+ 1), return . (+ 2)] -- Stream of functions
        & fmap ($ x)                                 -- Stream of lazy actions
        & Stream.parSequence (Stream.ordered True)   -- Evaluate concurrently
        & Stream.fold Fold.toList                    -- Fold to list
```

Use `parApply` to zip streams concurrently. Here, we zip three singleton
streams:

```haskell ghci

f2 x =
  let app = Stream.parApply id
  in (,,)
      `fmap` Stream.fromEffect (return $ show x)
      `app`  Stream.fromEffect (return $ x + 1)
      `app`  Stream.fromEffect (return $ fromIntegral x / 2)
  & Stream.fold Fold.one
```

Applying a function concurrently to your input stream:

```haskell ghci
g f xs =
  Stream.fromList xs
    & Stream.parMapM (Stream.ordered True) f
    & Stream.fold Fold.toList
```

You can now use the concurrent map to pipe each element through multiple
transformations using the distribute/zip operations.

```haskell docspec
>>> g f1 [1,2,3,4::Int]
[[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6]]

>>> g f2 [1,2,3,4::Int]
[Just ("1",2,0.5),Just ("2",3,1.0),Just ("3",4,1.5),Just ("4",5,2.0)]
```

Instead of using `parApply` directly, you can use `mkZipType` to
create a zip Applicative newtype so that you can use the `Applicative`
instance.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

import Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.TypeGen

app = parApply id
$(mkZippingType "ZipConcurrent" "app" True)
```

## Sliding Window

The `createOfLast` fold can be used to create a stream of sliding windows.

```haskell docspec
>>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Array as Array
>>> :{
  Stream.fromList [1,2,3,4,5::Int]
& Stream.scan (Array.createOfLast 2)
& Stream.fold Fold.toList
:}
[fromList [],fromList [1],fromList [1,2],fromList [2,3],fromList [3,4],fromList [4,5]]
```

Also see the "Streamly.Internal.Data.Fold.Window" module for widnow based folds.
