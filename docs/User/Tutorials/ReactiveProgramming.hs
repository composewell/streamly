-- a look at the Streamly concurrent programming tutorial.

-- $reactive
--
-- Reactive programming is nothing but concurrent streaming which is what
-- streamly is all about. With streamly we can generate streams of events,
-- merge streams that are generated concurrently and process events
-- concurrently. We can do all this without any knowledge about the specifics
-- of the implementation of concurrency. In the following example you will see
-- that the code is just regular Haskell code without much streamly APIs used
-- (active hyperlinks are the streamly APIs) and yet it is a reactive
-- application.
--
-- This application has two independent and concurrent sources of event
-- streams, @acidRain@ and @userAction@. @acidRain@ continuously generates
-- events that deteriorate the health of the character in the game.
-- @userAction@ can be "potion" or "quit". When the user types "potion" the
-- health improves and the game continues.

-- You can also find the source of this example in the streamly-examples repo
-- as <https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples/tree/master/AcidRain.hs AcidRain.hs>.
-- It has been adapted from Gabriel's
-- <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-concurrency-2.0.8/docs/Pipes-Concurrent-Tutorial.html pipes-concurrency>
-- package.
-- This is much simpler compared to the pipes version because of the builtin
-- concurrency in streamly. You can also find a SDL based reactive programming
-- example adapted from Yampa in
-- <https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples/tree/master/CirclingSquare.hs CirclingSquare.hs>.

-- $performance
--
-- Streamly is highly optimized for performance, it is designed for serious
-- high performing, concurrent and scalable applications. We have created the
-- <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-benchmarks streaming-benchmarks>
-- package which is specifically and carefully designed to measure the
-- performance of Haskell streaming libraries fairly and squarely in the right
-- way. Streamly performs at par or even better than most streaming libraries
-- for serial operations even though it needs to deal with the concurrency
-- capability.
