-- =Overview
--
-- Use 'watchRecursive' with a list of file system paths you want to watch as
-- argument. It returns a stream of 'Event' representing the file system events
-- occurring under the watched paths.
--
-- @
-- {-\# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}
-- Stream.mapM_ (putStrLn . 'showEvent') $ 'watchRecursive' [Array.fromList "path"]
-- @
--
-- 'Event' is an opaque type. Accessor functions (e.g. 'showEvent' above)
-- provided in this module are used to determine the attributes of the event.
--
-- =Design notes
--
-- For reference documentation see:
--
-- * "<https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/UsingtheFSEventsFramework/UsingtheFSEventsFramework.html Apple FS Events Programming Guide>"
-- * "<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events?language=objc Apple FS Events Reference>"
--
-- We try to keep the macOS\/Linux/Windows event handling APIs and defaults
-- semantically and syntactically as close as possible.
--
-- =BUGS
--
-- XXX Check the behavior for Windows/Linux where applicable. Mention these in
-- the common module so that users are aware of the portability issues.
--
-- There may be some idiosyncrasies in event reporting.
--
-- 1. Multiple events may be coalesced into a single event having multiple
-- flags set.  For example, on macOS 10.15.6, "touch x; rm x" or "touch x; mv x
-- y" produces an event with both "Created" and "Deleted/Moved" flags set.
--
-- 2. The same event can occur multiple times. For example, "touch x; sleep 1;
-- rm x" generates a "Created" event followed by an event with both "Created"
-- and "Deleted" flags set. Similarly, a cloned event can also occur multiple
-- times.
--
-- 3. Some events can go missing and only the latest one is reported. See
-- 'isCreated' for one such case.
--
-- XXX write a test case for this, and check on all platforms.
--
-- 4. When @rm -rf@ is used on the watched root directory, only one 'isDeleted'
-- event occurs and that is for the root. However, @rm -rf@ on a directory
-- inside the watch root produces 'isDeleted' events for all files.
--
-- XXX write a test case for this, and check on all platforms.
--
-- 5. When a file is moved, a move event occurs for both the source and the
-- destination files. There seems to be no way to distinguish the source and
-- the destination. Perhaps the lower eventId can be considered as source.
--
-- XXX cloned event is specific to macOS.  Translate it to the same events as
-- on copying.
--
-- 6. When a file is cloned both source and destination generate a cloned
-- event, however the source has lower eventId and destination may have
-- OwnerGroupModeChanged, InodeAttrsChanged, Created flags as well.
--
-- You may have to stat the path of the event to know more information about
-- what might have happened.  It may be a good idea to watch the behavior of
-- events you are handling before you can rely on it. See the individual event
-- APIs for some of the known issues marked with `BUGS`. Also see the "Handling
-- Events" section in the "Apple FS Events Programming Guide".

--
-- =TODO
--
-- APIs for persistent event-id related functionality, to get events from
-- specific event-id etc are not implemented.

-- | Start monitoring a list of file system paths for file system events with
-- the supplied configuration operation over the 'defaultConfig'. The paths
-- could be files or directories.  When the path is a directory and recursive
-- mode is set, the whole directory tree under it is watched recursively.
-- Monitoring starts from the current time onwards. The paths are specified as
-- UTF-8 encoded 'Array' of 'Word8'.
--
-- Important notes for macOS specific behavior:
--
-- From the observed behavior it seems macOS watches the paths, whatever they
-- are pointing to at any given point of time:
--
-- /Watch root deletion:/ If the the watch root is deleted and then recreated,
-- the newly created file or directory is automatically watched.
--
-- /Watch root moved:/ If the watch root is moved to a new path, the object
-- will no longer be watched unless the new path is also being watched and was
-- pointing to an existing file at the time of starting the watch (see notes
-- about non-existing paths below).
--
-- /Symbolic link watch root:/ If the path name to be watched is a symbolic
-- link then the target of the link is watched instead of the symbolic link
-- itself. It is equivalent to as if the target of the symbolic link itself was
-- directly added to the watch API. That is, the symbolic link is resolved at
-- the time of adding the watch.
--
-- Note that if a watched path is deleted and recreated as a symbolic link
-- pointing to another path then the symbolic link file itself is watched, it
-- won't be resolved. The symbolic link resolution happens only at the time of
-- adding the watch.
--
-- /Non-existing Paths:/ If a watch is started on a non-existing path then the
-- path is not watched even if it is created later.  The macOS API does not
-- fail for a non-existing path.
--
-- If a non-existing path is watched with 'setRootPathEvents' then an
-- 'isRootPathEvent' event is reported if the path is created later and the
-- "path" field in the event is set to the dirname of the path rather than the
-- full absolute path. This is the observed behavior on macOS 10.15.1.

    kFSEventStreamEventFlagItemCreated :: Word32

-- | Determine whether the event indicates creation of an object within the
-- monitored path. This event is generated when any file system object other
-- than a hard link is created.  On hard linking only an 'isAttrsModified'
-- event on the directory is generated, it is not a create event. However, when
-- a hard link is deleted 'isDeleted' and 'isHardLink' both are true.
--
-- This event can occur for the watched path if the path was deleted/moved and
-- created again (tested on macOS 10.15.1). However, if a watch is started on a
-- non-existing path and the path is created later, then this event is not
-- generated, the path is not watched.
--
-- BUGS: On 10.15.1 when we use a "touch x" to create a file for the first time
-- only an 'isAttrsModified' event occurs and there is no 'isCreated'
-- event. However, this seems to have been fixed on 10.15.6.
