-- | A 'Sink' is a special type of 'Foldl' that does not accumulate any value,
-- but runs only effects. A 'Sink' has no state to maintain therefore can be a
-- bit more efficient than a 'Foldl' with '()' as the state, especially when
-- 'Sink's are composed with other operations. A Sink can be upgraded to a
-- 'Foldl', but a 'Foldl' cannot be converted into a Sink.
