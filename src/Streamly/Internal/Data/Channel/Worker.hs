-- XXX There are a number of gotchas in measuring latencies.
-- 1) We measure latencies only when a worker yields a value
-- 2) It is possible that a stream calls the stop continuation, in which case
-- the worker would not yield a value and we would not account that worker in
-- latencies. Even though this case should ideally be accounted we do not
-- account it because we cannot or do not distinguish it from the case
-- described next.
-- 3) It is possible that a worker returns without yielding anything because it
-- never got a chance to pick up work.
-- 4) If the system timer resolution is lower than the latency, the latency
-- computation turns out to be zero.

-- We can fix this if we measure the latencies by counting the work items

-- | Describes how to pace the work based on current measurement estimates. If

-- ('BlockWait'), or send just one worker with limited yield count
-- ('PartialWorker') or send more than one workers with max yield count of each
-- limited to the total maximum target count.

-- | Another magic number! When we have to start more workers to cover up a
-- number of yields that we are lagging by then we cannot start one worker for
-- each yield because that may be a very big number and if the latency of the
-- workers is low these number of yields could be very high. We assume that we
