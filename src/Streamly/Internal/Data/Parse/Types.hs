-- Streaming and backtracking parsers.
--
-- A parser is a generalization of a classical left fold. A fold never fails,
-- it always produces a result, it has a default initial value. A parser may
-- terminate or fail even without producing any result.

-- Differences between a terminating fold and a parser:
--
-- \* A Parser is a superset of terminating fold with failure and backtracking
--   added.
-- \* A fold may be upgraded to a parser but vice versa is not true.
-- \* A fold is not a partial function, as it may never fail.
-- \* A fold's Step result is simpler as it does not backtrack.
-- \* A fold's result type is simpler as it does not fail and it does not return
--   unused input count.
--
-- Parse and Zip (zipWith) is possible only if both the parses are unskipping
-- or are guaranteed to have outputs in sync. Or else we will have to keep the
-- input buffered and may have to end the zip when one of them finishes. This
-- is simple if the type guarantees no skip e.g. in case of classical left
-- folds.
--
-- Terminating folds can have Sequential and Distribute and zip style
-- applicatives but cannot have Alternative.
--
-- Parsers can have Sequential Applicative and Alternative but not Distribute
-- and zip style applicative.
--
-- We can distribute and scan/parse a stream using both folds and parsers and
-- merge the resulting streams using different merge strategies (e.g.
-- interleaving or serial).

-- | The return type of a fold step. A fold is driven by a fold driver one step
-- at a time, at any time the driver may @extract@ and examine the result of
-- the fold. The fold may backtrack at any point, therefore, the driver holds
-- the input in a backtracking buffer. The buffer grows or shrinks based on the
-- return values of the fold step execution.
--
-- When a fold step is executed it generates a new state of the fold along with
-- a command to the fold driver. The command tells the fold driver whether to
-- keep the input for future backtracking or drop it. The constructors of
-- 'Step' represent the commands to the driver.

      Hold s     -- ^ Hold the current input in the buffer, the input is
                 -- accepted tentatively, but the fold may later fail with the
                 -- input remaining unused.
    | Keep Int s -- ^ Keep @n@ most recent inputs, including the input of this
                 -- step invocation, and discard the rest.  This indicates a
                 -- commit of an intermediate result of the fold. A fold cannot
                 -- fail beyond this commit point. If the fold terminates it
                 -- will return at least the result up to this commit and the
                 -- count of unused elements after that.
    | Back Int s -- ^ Go back in the buffer by @n@ items, the count @n@
                 -- includes the input element of this step as well. The fold
                 -- driver backtracks and starts driving the fold with past
                 -- inputs from the requested point in the buffer. Note that
                 -- the driver cannot go back beyond the last commit point
                 -- created by 'Keep'.
    | Halt s     -- ^ Halt because the result of the fold will not change after
                 -- this point.  Once a fold halts, driving it further may
                 -- produce undefined behavior. An @extract@ after the 'Halt'
                 -- would return a count of unused elements which includes the
                 -- element on which 'Halt' occurred.

-- Note: Instead of returning the unused count as part of extract, we can
-- return it via Halt command. However, some folds may not ever halt, but they
-- may still have unused input after the last commit point.

-- | A parsing fold is represented as @Parse step initial extract@. Before we
-- drive a fold we call the @initial@ action to retrieve the initial state of
-- the fold. The driver invokes @step@ with the previous state and an input
-- element. It results into a new state and a command to the driver represented
-- by 'Step' type. At any point of time the driver can call @extract@ to
-- inspect the result of the fold. It may result in an error or an output value
-- along with the count (zero or more) of last unused elements.
