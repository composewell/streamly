-- = Stream Consumers
--
-- We can classify stream consumers in the following categories in order of
-- increasing complexity and power:
--
-- == Accumulators
--
-- These are the simplest folds that never fail and never terminate, they
-- accumulate the input values forever and can always accept new inputs (never
-- terminate) and always have a valid result value.  A
-- 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Fold.sum' operation is an example of an accumulator.
-- Traditional Haskell left folds like 'foldl' are accumulators.
--
-- We can distribute an input stream to two or more accumulators using a @tee@
-- style composition.  Accumulators cannot be applied on a stream one after the
-- other, which we call a @serial@ append style composition of folds. This is
-- because accumulators never terminate, since the first accumulator in a
-- series will never terminate, the next one will never get to run.
--
-- == Terminating Folds
--
-- Terminating folds are accumulators that can terminate. Once a fold
-- terminates it no longer accepts any more inputs.  Terminating folds can be
-- used in a @serial@ append style composition where one fold can be applied
-- after the other on an input stream. We can apply a terminating fold
-- repeatedly on an input stream, splitting the stream and consuming it in
-- fragments.  Terminating folds never fail, therefore, they do not need
-- backtracking.
--
-- The 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Fold.take' operation is an example of a
-- terminating fold  It terminates after consuming @n@ items. Coupled with an
-- accumulator (e.g. sum) it can be used to split and process the stream into
-- chunks of fixed size.
--
-- == Terminating Folds with Leftovers
--
-- The next upgrade after terminating folds is terminating folds with leftover
-- inputs.  Consider the example of @takeWhile@ operation, it needs to inspect
-- an element for termination decision. However, it does not consume the
-- element on which it terminates. To implement @takeWhile@ a terminating fold
-- will have to implement a way to return unconsumed input to the fold driver.
--
-- Single element leftover case is the most common and its easy to implement it
-- in terminating folds using a @Done1@ constructor in the 'Step' type which
-- indicates that the last element was not consumed by the fold. The following
-- additional operations can be implemented as terminating folds if we do that.
--
-- @
-- takeWhile
-- groupBy
-- wordBy
-- @
--
-- However, it creates several complications.  The 'many' combinator  requires
-- a @Partial1@ ('Partial' with leftover) to handle a @Done1@ from the top
-- level fold, for efficient implementation.  If the collecting fold in "many"
-- returns a @Partial1@ or @Done1@ then what to do with all the elements that
-- have been consumed?
--
-- Similarly, in distribute, if one fold consumes a value and others say its a
-- leftover then what do we do?  Folds like "many" require the leftover to be
-- fed to it again. So in a distribute operation those folds which gave a
-- leftover will have to be fed the leftover while the folds that consumed will
-- have to be fed the next input.  This is very complicated to implement. We
-- have the same issue in backtracking parsers being used in a distribute
-- operation.
--
-- To avoid these issues we want to enforce by typing that the collecting folds
-- can never return a leftover. So we need a fold type without @Done1@ or
-- @Partial1@. This leads us to design folds to never return a leftover and the
-- use cases of single leftover are transferred to parsers where we have
-- general backtracking mechanism and single leftover is just a special case of
-- backtracking.
--
-- This means: takeWhile, groupBy, wordBy would be implemented as parsers.
-- "take 0" can implemented as a fold if we make initial return @Step@ type.
-- "takeByTime" can be implemented without @Done1@.
--
-- == Parsers
--
-- The next upgrade after terminating folds with a leftover are parsers.
-- Parsers are terminating folds that can fail and backtrack. Parsers can be
-- composed using an @alternative@ style composition where they can backtrack
-- and apply another parser if one parser fails.
-- 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Parser.satisfy' is a simple example of a parser, it
-- would succeed if the condition is satisfied and it would fail otherwise, on
-- failure an alternative parser can be used on the same input.
--
-- = Types for Stream Consumers
--
-- In streamly, there is no separate type for accumulators. Terminating folds
-- are a superset of accumulators and to avoid too many types we represent both
-- using the same type, 'Fold'.
--
-- We do not club the leftovers functionality with terminating folds because of
-- the reasons explained earlier. Instead combinators that require leftovers
-- are implemented as the 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Parser.Parser' type.  This is
-- a sweet spot to balance ease of use, type safety and performance.  Using
-- separate Accumulator and terminating fold types would encode more
-- information in types but it would make ease of use, implementation,
-- maintenance effort worse. Combining Accumulator, terminating folds and
-- Parser into a single 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Parser.Parser' type would make
-- ease of use even better but type safety and performance worse.
--
-- One of the design requirements that we have placed for better ease of use
-- and code reuse is that 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Parser.Parser' type should be
-- a strict superset of the 'Fold' type i.e. it can do everything that a 'Fold'
-- can do and more. Therefore, folds can be easily upgraded to parsers and we
-- can use parser combinators on folds as well when needed.
--
-- = Fold Design
--
-- A fold is represented by a collection of "initial", "step" and "extract"
-- functions. The "initial" action generates the initial state of the fold. The
-- state is internal to the fold and maintains the accumulated output. The
-- "step" function is invoked using the current state and the next input value
-- and results in a @Partial@ or @Done@. A @Partial@ returns the next intermediate
-- state of the fold, a @Done@ indicates that the fold has terminated and
-- returns the final value of the accumulator.
--
-- Every @Partial@ indicates that a new accumulated output is available.  The
-- accumulated output can be extracted from the state at any point using
-- "extract". "extract" can never fail. A fold returns a valid output even
-- without any input i.e. even if you call "extract" on "initial" state it
-- provides an output. This is not true for parsers.
--
-- In general, "extract" is used in two cases:
--
-- * When the fold is used as a scan @extract@ is called on the intermediate
-- state every time it is yielded by the fold, the resulting value is yielded
-- as a stream.
-- * When the fold is used as a regular fold, @extract@ is called once when
-- we are done feeding input to the fold.
--
-- = Alternate Designs
--
-- An alternate and simpler design would be to return the intermediate output
-- via @Partial@ along with the state, instead of using "extract" on the yielded
-- state and remove the extract function altogether.
--
-- This may even facilitate more efficient implementation.  Extract from the
-- intermediate state after each yield may be more costly compared to the fold
-- step itself yielding the output. The fold may have more efficient ways to
-- retrieve the output rather than stuffing it in the state and using extract
-- on the state.
--
-- However, removing extract altogether may lead to less optimal code in some
-- cases because the driver of the fold needs to thread around the intermediate
-- output to return it if the stream stops before the fold could @Done@.  When
-- using this approach, the @parseMany (FL.take filesize)@ benchmark shows a
-- 2x worse performance even after ensuring everything fuses.  So we keep the
-- "extract" approach to ensure better perf in all cases.
--
-- But we could still yield both state and the output in @Partial@, the output
-- can be used for the scan use case, instead of using extract. Extract would
-- then be used only for the case when the stream stops before the fold
-- completes.
