-- IMPORTANT NOTE: we cannot update the SVar after generating it as we have
-- references to the original SVar stored in several functions which will keep
-- pointing to the original data and the new updates won't reflect there.
-- Any updateable parts must be kept in mutable references (IORef).

-- XXX Since we have stream specific channels now, we can remove functions like
-- enqueue, readOuputQ, postProcess, workLoop etc from this.

-- | A mutable channel to evaluate multiple streams concurrently and provide
-- the combined results as output stream.

    -- avoid constructing and reversing the list. Possibly we can also avoid
    -- the GC copying overhead. When the size increases we should be able to
    -- allocate the array in chunks.
    --
    -- [LOCKING] Frequent locked access. This is updated by workers on each
    -- yield and once in a while read by the consumer thread. This could have
    -- big locking overhead if the number of workers is high.

    -- XXX We can use a per-CPU data structure to reduce the locking overhead.
    -- However, a per-cpu structure cannot guarantee the exact sequence in
    -- which the elements were added, though that may not be important.
    -- XXX We can send a bundle of events of one type coaleseced together in an
    -- unboxed structure.
