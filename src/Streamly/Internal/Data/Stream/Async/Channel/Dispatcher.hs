-- Every once in a while workers update the latencies and check the yield rate.
-- They return if we are above the expected yield rate. If we check too often
-- it may impact performance, if we check less often we may have a stale
-- picture. We update every minThreadDelay but we translate that into a yield
-- count based on latency so that the checking overhead is little.
--
-- XXX use a generation count to indicate that the value is updated. If the
-- value is updated an existing worker must check it again on the next yield.
-- Otherwise it is possible that we may keep updating it and because of the mod
-- worker keeps skipping it.

        -- queue empty, even though the whole work has not finished yet.

        -- sleep indefinitely unless the active workers produce some

        -- workers depends on the future workers that we may never send.

        -- the enqueue to send us a doorbell.

        -- Note that this is just a best effort mechanism to avoid a
        -- deadlock. Deadlocks may still happen if for some weird reason
        -- the consuming computation shares an MVar or some other resource
        -- with the producing computation and gets blocked on that resource
        -- and therefore cannot do any pushworker to add more threads to
        -- the producer. In such cases the programmer should use a parallel
        -- style so that all the producers are scheduled immediately and
        -- unconditionally. We can also use a separate monitor thread to
        -- push workers instead of pushing them from the consumer, but then

        -- Having pending active workers does not mean that we are guaranteed

        -- processed by the consumer. We should either guarantee that any
        -- worker, before returning, clears the heap or we send a worker to
        -- clear it. Normally we always send a worker if no output is seen, but
        -- if the thread limit is reached or we are using pacing then we may
        -- not send a worker. See the concurrentApplication test in the tests,
        -- that test case requires at least one yield from the producer to not
        -- deadlock, if the last workers output is stuck in the heap then this
        -- test fails.  This problem can be extended to n threads when the
        -- consumer may depend on the evaluation of next n items in the
        -- producer stream.
