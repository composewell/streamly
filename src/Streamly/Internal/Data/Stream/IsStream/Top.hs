-- TODO: OrdSet/IntSet/hashmap based versions of these. With Eq only
-- constraint, the best would be to use an Array with linear search. If the
-- second stream is sorted we can also use a binary search, using Ord
-- constraint or an ordering function.
--
-- For Storables we can cache the second stream into an unboxed array for
-- possibly faster access/compact representation?
--
-- If we do not want to keep the stream in memory but always read it from the
-- source (disk/network) every time we iterate through it then we can do that
-- too by reading the stream every time, the stream must have immutable state
-- in that case and the user is responsible for the behavior if the stream
-- source changes during iterations. We can also use an Unfold instead of
-- stream. We probably need a way to distinguish streams that can be read
-- mutliple times without any interference (e.g. unfolding a stream using an
-- immutable handle would work i.e. using pread/pwrite instead of maintianing
-- an offset in the handle).

-- XXX We can do this concurrently.
--
-- | This is the same as 'Streamly.Internal.Data.Unfold.outerProduct' but less
-- efficient.
--
-- The second stream is evaluated multiple times. If the second stream is
-- consume-once stream then it can be cached in an 'Data.Array.Array' before
-- calling this function. Caching may also improve performance if the stream is
-- expensive to evaluate.
