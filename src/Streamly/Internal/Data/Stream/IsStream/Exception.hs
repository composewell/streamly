-- | Run the alloc action @m b@ with async exceptions disabled but keeping
-- blocking operations interruptible (see 'Control.Exception.mask').  Use the
-- output @b@ as input to @b -> t m a@ to generate an output stream.
--
-- @b@ is usually a resource under the state of monad @m@, e.g. a file
-- handle, that requires a cleanup after use. The cleanup action @b -> m c@,
-- runs whenever the stream ends normally, due to a sync or async exception or
-- if it gets garbage collected after a partial lazy evaluation.
--
-- 'bracket' only guarantees that the cleanup action runs, and it runs with
-- async exceptions enabled. The action must ensure that it can successfully
-- cleanup the resource in the face of sync or async exceptions.
--
-- When the stream ends normally or on a sync exception, cleanup action runs
-- immediately in the current thread context, whereas in other cases it runs in
-- the GC context, therefore, cleanup may be delayed until the GC gets to run.

-- For a use case of this see the "streamly-process" package. It needs to kill
-- the process in case of exception or garbage collection, but waits for the
-- process to terminate in normal cases.
--
-- | Like 'bracket' but can use separate cleanup actions depending on the mode
-- of termination.  @bracket' before onStop onGC onException action@ runs
-- @action@ using the result of @before@. If the stream stops, @onStop@ action
-- is executed, if the stream is abandoned @onGC@ is executed, if the stream
-- encounters an exception @onException@ is executed.

-- | Like 'handle' but the exception handler is also provided with the stream
-- that generated the exception as input. The exception handler can thus
-- re-evaluate the stream to retry the action that failed. The exception
-- handler can again call 'ghandle' on it to retry the action multiple times.
--
-- This is highly experimental. In a stream of actions we can map the stream
-- with a retry combinator to retry each action on failure.

-- | @retry@ takes 3 arguments
--
-- 1. A map @m@ whose keys are exceptions and values are the number of times to
-- retry the action given that the exception occurs.
--
-- 2. A handler @han@ that decides how to handle an exception when the exception
-- cannot be retried.
--
-- 3. The stream itself that we want to run this mechanism on.
--
-- When evaluating a stream if an exception occurs,
--
-- 1. The stream evaluation aborts
--
-- 2. The exception is looked up in @m@
--
--    a. If the exception exists and the mapped value is > 0 then,
--
--       i. The value is decreased by 1.
--
--       ii. The stream is resumed from where the exception was called, retrying
--       the action.
--
--    b. If the exception exists and the mapped value is == 0 then the stream
--    evaluation stops.
--
--    c. If the exception does not exist then we handle the exception using
--    @han@.
