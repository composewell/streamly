-- | Specify the maximum number of threads that can be spawned concurrently for
-- any concurrent combinator in a stream.
-- A value of 0 resets the thread limit to default, a negative value means
-- there is no limit. The default value is 1500. 'maxThreads' does not affect
-- 'ParallelT' streams as they can use unbounded number of threads.
--
-- When the actions in a stream are IO bound, having blocking IO calls, this
-- option can be used to control the maximum number of in-flight IO requests.
-- When the actions are CPU bound this option can be used to
-- control the amount of CPU used by the stream.

-- XXX The actual buffer size can be double of the specified value because the
-- consumer thread takes the whole buffer in one go and decrements the used
-- buffer space to 0. Since the full buffer space is now available to the
-- producers they can again fill it even though the consumer may not yet have
-- actually consumed any of the previous items. So the actual buffer is in the
-- range n and 2n where n is the buffer size specified by the user. We can make
-- this precise by having the consumer also modify the buffer count, but then
-- there will be more lock contention.
--
-- | Specify the maximum size of the buffer for storing the results from
-- concurrent computations. If the buffer becomes full we stop spawning more
-- concurrent tasks until there is space in the buffer.
-- A value of 0 resets the buffer size to default, a negative value means
-- there is no limit. The default value is 1500.
--
-- CAUTION! using an unbounded 'maxBuffer' value (i.e. a negative value)
-- coupled with an unbounded 'maxThreads' value is a recipe for disaster in
-- presence of infinite streams, or very large streams.  Especially, it must
-- not be used when 'pure' is used in 'ZipAsyncM' streams as 'pure' in
-- applicative zip streams generates an infinite stream causing unbounded
-- concurrent generation with no limit on the buffer or threads.

-- effective maximum production rate achieved by a stream is governed by:
--
-- * The 'maxThreads' limit
-- * The 'maxBuffer' limit
-- * The maximum rate that the stream producer can achieve
-- * The maximum rate that the stream consumer can achieve

-- | Specify the average latency, in nanoseconds, of a single threaded action
-- in a concurrent composition. Streamly can measure the latencies, but that is
-- possible only after at least one task has completed. This combinator can be
-- used to provide a latency hint so that rate control using 'rate' can take
-- that into account right from the beginning. When not specified then a
-- default behavior is chosen which could be too slow or too fast, and would be
-- restricted by any other control parameters configured.
-- A value of 0 indicates default behavior, a negative value means there is no
-- limit i.e. zero latency.
-- This would normally be useful only in high latency and high throughput
-- cases.
