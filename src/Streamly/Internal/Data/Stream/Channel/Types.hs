-- A Channel is a place where streams join and new streams start. This module
-- defines low level data structures and functions to build channels. For
-- concrete Channels see the Channel modules of specific stream types.
--
-- A Channel is a conduit to the output from multiple streams running
-- concurrently and asynchronously. A channel can be thought of as an
-- asynchronous IO handle. We can write any number of streams to a channel in a
-- non-blocking manner and then read them back at any time at any pace.  The
-- channel would run the streams asynchronously and accumulate results. A
-- channel may not really execute the stream completely and accumulate all the
-- results. However, it ensures that the reader can read the results at
-- whatever pace it wants to read. The channel monitors and adapts to the
-- consumer's pace.
--
-- A channel is a mini scheduler, it has an associated workLoop that holds the
-- stream tasks to be picked and run by a pool of worker threads. It has an
-- associated output queue where the output stream elements are placed by the
-- worker threads. An outputDoorBell is used by the worker threads to intimate the
-- consumer thread about availability of new results in the output queue. More
-- workers are added to the channel by 'fromChannel' on demand if the output
-- produced is not keeping pace with the consumer. On bounded channels, workers
-- block on the output queue to provide throttling of the producer  when the
-- consumer is not pulling fast enough.  The number of workers may even get
-- reduced depending on the consuming pace.
