-- IMPORTANT NOTE: we cannot update the SVar after generating it as we have
-- references to the original SVar stored in several functions which will keep
-- pointing to the original data and the new updates won't reflect there.
-- Any updateable parts must be kept in mutable references (IORef).

-- XXX Since we have stream specific channels now, we can remove functions like
-- enqueue, readOuputQ, postProcess, workLoop etc from this.

-- | A mutable channel to evaluate multiple streams concurrently and provide
-- the combined results as output stream.

-- There are only two actors working on the channel data structure, the event
-- processing loop (single thread), and the workers (multiple threads). Locking
-- notes are provided below for concurrent access.

-- When a worker is dispatched, a 'WorkerInfo' record is supplied to it by the

-- the channel's 'workerPendingLatency' stat. It is done only if the

-- when rate control is enabled, it might confuse the rate control mechanism if
-- we use workers beyond the knowledge of dispatcher.
