-- Generating streams from a channel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- $concurrentEval
--
-- Usually a channel is used to concurrently evaluate multiple actions in a
-- stream using many worker threads that push the results to the channel and a
-- single puller that pulls them from channel generating the evaluated stream.
--
-- @
--                  input stream
--                       |
--     <-----------------|<--------worker
--     |  exceptions     |
-- output stream <---Channel<------worker
--                       |
--                       |<--------worker
--
-- @
--
-- The puller itself schedules the worker threads based on demand.
-- Exceptions are propagated from the worker threads to the puller.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Write a stream to a channel
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- XXX Should be a Fold, singleton API could be called joinChannel, or the fold
-- can be called joinChannel.
-- XXX If we use toChannelK multiple times on a channel make sure the channel
-- does not go away before we use the subsequent ones.

-- | High level function to enqueue a work item on the channel. The fundamental
-- unit of work is a stream. Each stream enqueued on the channel is picked up
-- and evaluated by a worker thread. The worker evaluates the stream it picked
-- up serially. When multiple streams are queued on the channel each stream can
-- be evaluated concurrently by different workers.
--
-- Note that the items in each stream are not concurrently evaluated, streams
-- are fundamentally serial, therefore, elements in one particular stream will
-- be generated serially one after the other. Only two or more streams can be
-- run concurrently with each other.
--
-- See 'chanConcatMapK' for concurrent evaluation of each element of a stream.
-- Alternatively, you can wrap each element of the original stream into a
-- stream generating action and queue all those streams on the channel. Then
-- all of them would be evaluated concurrently. However, that would not be
-- streaming in nature, it would require buffering space for the entire
-- original stream. Prefer 'chanConcatMapK' for larger streams.
--
-- Items from each evaluated streams are queued to the same output queue of the
-- channel which can be read using 'fromChannelK'. 'toChannelK' can be called
-- multiple times to enqueue multiple streams on the channel.

-- | Draw a stream from a concurrent channel. The stream consists of the
-- evaluated values from the input streams that were enqueued on the channel
-- using 'toChannelK'.
--
-- This is the event processing loop for the channel which does two
-- things, (1) dispatch workers, (2) process the events sent by the workers.
-- Workers are dispatched based on the channel's configuration settings.
--
-- The stream stops and the channel is shutdown if any of the following occurs:
--
-- * the work queue becomes empty
-- * channel's max yield limit is reached
-- * an exception is thrown by a worker
-- * 'shutdown' is called on the channel
--
-- Before the channel stops, all the workers are drained and no more workers
-- are dispatched. When the channel is garbage collected a 'ThreadAbort'
-- exception is thrown to all pending workers. If 'inspect' option is enabled
-- then channel's stats are printed on stdout when the channel stops.
--
-- CAUTION! This API must not be called more than once on a channel.
